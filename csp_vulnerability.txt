Insufficient Control of User Interface Layers or Frames (CSP)
-------------------------------------------------------------
A web application is expected to implement restrictions on its rendering within frames, iframes, objects, embeds, or applet elements. The lack of these limita@on could result in user inadvertently interac@ng with the application, increasing the risk of manipulation or exploitation. In our analysis to assess whether the tested website enforces frame restrictions.

What is CSP (Content Security Policy)?
CSP (Content Security Policy) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent a wide range of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. CSP allows you to define and control which resources (scripts, images, styles, etc.) can be loaded and executed on your website. By doing so, it reduces the risk of malicious content being loaded and executed on your site.

How CSP Works:
CSP works by allowing website owners to declare which domains the browser is allowed to load content from, such as scripts, styles, images, and other resources. If a malicious script is injected, CSP can block it from running.

A CSP is typically defined in the HTTP headers or via a <meta> tag, and it uses various directives to specify allowed content sources.

For example, the Content-Security-Policy header might look like this:
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-scripts.com; style-src 'self' https://trusted-styles.com; img-src 'self' https://trusted-images.com;

This policy means:
Only allow content (by default) from the same origin ('self').
Allow JavaScript (script-src) from the same origin and from https://trusted-scripts.com.
Allow styles (style-src) from the same origin and from https://trusted-styles.com.
Allow images (img-src) from the same origin and https://trusted-images.com.

Why CSP is Important:
Prevent XSS Attacks: CSP prevents malicious scripts from executing by only allowing scripts from trusted sources.
Control Resource Loading: It allows you to control which resources can be loaded from external domains.
Mitigate Data Injection: CSP helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious content, including data leaks.
How to Implement CSP in a Django Project
You can implement CSP in a Django project by setting the appropriate HTTP headers. There are two main ways to set CSP in Django: using middleware or using third-party packages.

Option 1: Using a Third-Party Package (django-csp)
The easiest way to implement CSP in Django is by using the third-party package django-csp.

1. Install the django-csp Package:
First, you need to install the django-csp package, which provides middleware for setting up CSP headers in Django.
command:
pip install django-csp

2. Add django-csp to INSTALLED_APPS and MIDDLEWARE:
In your settings.py file, add 'csp' to the INSTALLED_APPS list and add CSPMiddleware to the MIDDLEWARE list.

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other apps
    'csp',
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Other middleware
    'csp.middleware.CSPMiddleware',
]

3. Configure CSP in settings.py:
Now you can configure your CSP rules in settings.py. The django-csp package provides various settings to define a Content Security Policy.
Hereâ€™s an example CSP configuration:

# Default source (allowed content)
CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'self'",)

# Allow scripts from the same origin and specific external domains
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'", "https://trusted-scripts.com")

# Allow styles from the same origin and external styles
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'", "https://trusted-styles.com")

# Allow images from the same origin and trusted domains
CSP_IMG_SRC = ("'self'", "https://trusted-images.com")

# Allow fonts from the same origin and external font providers
CSP_FONT_SRC = ("'self'", "https://trusted-fonts.com")

# Allow connections to the same origin and trusted API domains
CSP_CONNECT_SRC = ("'self'", "https://trusted-apis.com")

# Allow frame embedding only from the same domain or trusted domains
CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS = ("'self'", "https://trusteddomain.com")

# Additional recommended CSP settings
CSP_REPORT_ONLY = True  # Only report violations, don't enforce them yet (for testing)

4. Test CSP Policies:
You can set the CSP_REPORT_ONLY flag to True while testing to log violations without enforcing the policy. This allows you to test your CSP rules without breaking functionality for legitimate resources.

CSP_REPORT_ONLY = True
CSP_REPORT_URI = '/csp-violation-report-endpoint/'  # URL for violation reports
You should implement a view to collect CSP violation reports, for example:

from django.http import JsonResponse

def csp_violation_report(request):
    # Log the CSP violation data to the database or an external service
    return JsonResponse({'status': 'reported'})
Add the URL for the CSP report in urls.py:

urlpatterns = [
    # Other URLs
    path('csp-violation-report-endpoint/', csp_violation_report),
]

5. Monitor and Adjust:
Once your CSP is in place, monitor any violation reports and adjust the policy as necessary. Over time, you may need to add more domains to the list of allowed sources, especially if you integrate more external services (e.g., CDN resources, APIs).

Option 2: Manually Adding CSP Headers Using Middleware
If you prefer not to use a third-party package, you can implement CSP by writing custom middleware to inject CSP headers into responses.

1. Create Middleware:
Create a new file called middleware.py in your Django app, and define a custom middleware to add the Content-Security-Policy header.

# middleware.py
class CSPMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        response = self.get_response(request)
        
        # Add CSP header
        response['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-scripts.com; style-src 'self' https://trusted-styles.com; img-src 'self' https://trusted-images.com;"
        
        return response

2. Add Middleware to settings.py:
In settings.py, add your custom middleware to the MIDDLEWARE list.

MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Other middleware
    'yourapp.middleware.CSPMiddleware',
]

3. Adjust the CSP Header:
Modify the value of the Content-Security-Policy header as per your application's needs (e.g., which domains to allow scripts, styles, etc. from).

For example, you can add additional domains for trusted resources like external APIs, fonts, etc.

response['Content-Security-Policy'] = (
    "default-src 'self'; "
    "script-src 'self' https://trusted-scripts.com; "
    "style-src 'self' https://trusted-styles.com; "
    "img-src 'self' https://trusted-images.com;"
)
